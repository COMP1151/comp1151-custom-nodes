# Recommended Components and Nodes

Unity has a lot of different components and scripting nodes available. Finding the ones you need can prove very difficult, especially since there is very little documentation. 
The official [Node reference](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.visualscripting@1.7/manual/vs-nodes-reference.html) page lists a handful of important nodes, 
but there are more we will be using (and many more than that besides). This page is inteneded as a reference to the subset of important nodes you will need for COMP1151.
The list is broken down by component.

Some of these nodes as labelled as 'Custom'. These have been written by the teaching staff as extensions to Unity to provide useful features. These will be included in
your prac or assignment framework code for you to use. You are also welcome to use these in your own projects, without restriction.
